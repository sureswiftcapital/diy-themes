============= Warning: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! =============

Please beware that editting this file could break your site as it's referenced in your theme's main theme.liquid file!

Also, if you're testing changes, please do so on a duplicate theme to avoid downtime for your users!

Instructions:
1) create a file named 'cross-sell-custom' inside of your Snippets folder.
Once created it SHOULD say 'cross-sell-custom.liquid' IF NOT, rename it.
2) make sure the 3 lines of code below are added BEFORE the </head> element of your theme.liquid file (or main theme file)

<!-- Cross Sell custom code start. Do not change -->
{%include 'cross-sell-custom'%}
<!-- Cross Sell custom code end. Do not change -->

3) Make sure you to SAVE the changes made to your theme.liquid file
4) Have Cross Sell's Settings -> Display Settings set to "custom" theme, and activate the carousel feature if needed.
5) Save your Settings
